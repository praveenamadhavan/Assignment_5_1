The aim of the project is to analyze the probability of a customer who is driving through the city in different conditions to accept a food coupon, The coupons can be for different categories like restaurants, bars, coffee house or take away and the factors contributing to the decision are varied like the passenger, weather, time of the day etc. 

Some of the observations regarding acceptance of bar coupon are

Acceptance rate of drivers who go to bars 4 or more times in a month is almost twice as that of those who go 3 or less times.
Drivers who are below 30 and go to bars more than once a month have great probability of accepting the coupon
Drivers who were not widowed do not tend to accept coupons when there is a passenger
Drivers over the age of 25 and who go to bar more than once a month are twice more likely to accept the coupons than others

Regarding acceptance of Coffee house coupons are

Acceptance rate is almost the same among female and male customers
Marital status (if they are married/together or single/widow/divorced) also display equal probability in accepting the coupon. 
Acceptance rate seems to be the highest among younger crowd , below 21 years of age than any others , with 50 plus age group showing the least probability
Acceptance rate of coffee coupon is more likely to happen between 10AM to 2 PM, with very probability after 6 PM

There are still many more factors affecting the decision making that can be analyzed. The weather, destination, passenger combined with the frequency of visiting each establishment and much more.
